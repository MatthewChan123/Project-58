            <p>PLaying the violin is fun to play and it make good music. I started playing violin in second grade. I practiced violin daily to get to where I am now. I practice at least 30 minutes everyday of playing the violin. Playing the violin makes my mom happy because she loves to listen to music so it makes me happy too. I have performed some songs for my school to hear. My violin teacher is nice to me and makes me want to be more better and learn more violin. I hope one day I will be able to be a professional violin musican.</p>
